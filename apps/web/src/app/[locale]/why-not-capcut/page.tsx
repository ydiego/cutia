				<p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
					CapCut is a popular video editor, but it uploads your media to remote
					servers, requires an account, and is closed-source proprietary
					software. Cutia takes a different approach: it runs entirely in your
					browser, your files never leave your device, and the source code is
					open for anyone to inspect. If you care about privacy, freedom, or
					simply want a video editor that works without sign-ups and
					watermarks, Cutia is designed for you.
