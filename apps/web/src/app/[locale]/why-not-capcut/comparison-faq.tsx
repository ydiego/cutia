			answer: t(
				"Cutia covers the core editing features most creators need: multi-track timeline, text and sticker overlays, AI image generation, audio transcription, and caption generation. CapCut offers additional advanced features like effects templates and more export formats, but Cutia is rapidly growing as an open-source project.",
			),

		{
			question: t("Is Cutia really free with no watermarks?"),

				"Yes. Cutia requires no sign-up or login. Just open the website and start editing immediately. Your projects are saved locally in your browser.",
			),
		},
		{
			question: t("Is Cutia open source?"),
			answer: t(
				"Yes. Cutia is fully open source and available on GitHub. You can inspect the code, contribute, fork it, or self-host it on your own server.",
			),
		},
		{
			question: t(
				"What AI features does Cutia offer compared to CapCut?",
			),
			answer: t(
				"Cutia is AI-native with a built-in AI agent that can edit videos from natural language prompts, AI image generation for creating visuals, and audio transcription for automatic caption generation. These features are integrated into the core editing workflow.",
